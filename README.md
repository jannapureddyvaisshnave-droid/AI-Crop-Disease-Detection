# AI-Based Crop Disease Detection Using Mobile Imaging

This project aims to help farmers detect crop diseases early using smartphone images of plant leaves. The system uses a lightweight machine learning model trained with Google Teachable Machine to provide fast and accessible disease detection.

## Problem Domain
AI for Rural Innovation & Sustainable Systems

## Key Features
- Image-based crop disease detection
- Simple and user-friendly interface
- Lightweight AI model
- Early diagnosis to reduce crop loss

## Technology Used
- Google Teachable Machine
- TensorFlow.js
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript

## Documentation
- `requirements.md` – Project requirements and objectives
- `design.md` – System architecture and design

## Note
This project focuses on simplicity, usability, and meaningful use of AI rather than complex rule-based systems.
