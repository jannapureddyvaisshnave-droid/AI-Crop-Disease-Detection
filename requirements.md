## 1. Project Overview  
This project introduces a straightforward and effective AI-based crop disease detection system. It uses smartphone images to spot plant diseases early. The solution relies on a lightweight machine learning model, which is trained using Google Teachable Machine. This makes it simple to build, deploy, and use while providing valuable AI-driven insights.

## 2. Problem Statement  
Many farmers in India face crop losses because of late or incorrect plant disease identification. Early symptoms appear as small visual changes on leaves, making them hard to see manually. Limited access to agricultural experts in rural areas worsens the issue.

The proposed solution helps farmers identify crop diseases early through a mobile device. It offers quick and easy diagnosis without depending on manual inspection.

## 3. Objectives  
- To offer early detection of crop diseases using AI-based image classification  
- To develop a simple and user-friendly mobile solution  
- To reduce crop loss through timely identification  
- To avoid complex or resource-heavy systems while still being effective  

## 4. Target Users  
- Small and marginal farmers  
- Agricultural field workers  

## 5. Functional Requirements  
- The system will allow users to upload or capture leaf images  
- The system will classify images as healthy or diseased  
- The system will show results instantly  
- The system will provide basic advice messages after detection  

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements  
- Simplicity: The system should be easy to understand and use  
- Performance: Results should be generated quickly  
- Scalability: The system should support multiple users  
- Accessibility: The solution should work on low-end smartphones  

## 7. AI Requirements  
- Use of image classification with machine learning  
- Model trained using Google Teachable Machine  
- Ability to learn visual patterns rather than fixed rules  
- No hard-coded logic for disease detection  

## 8. Constraints  
- Limited training data  
- Variations in image quality  
- Dependence on internet connection for model inference  

## 9. Assumptions  
- Users have access to a smartphone camera  
- Captured images are reasonably clear  
- Model predictions support decision-making but are not the final say  

## 10. Success Criteria  
- Accurate classification of crop leaf conditions  
- Ease of use for farmers  
- Quick response time
